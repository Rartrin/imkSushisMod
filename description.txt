Adds lots of recipes. But you probably knew that already.

The One, The Only, The Ultimate!

Now with even MORE stuff!

899 Recipes (not a typo, actually is over eight hundred recipes)!

This mod is the Ultimate Extra Recipes Mod. It makes equivalent Ores and Bars Interchangeable and makes items dependant on world gen have recipes as well. It also makes multiplayer more friendly, and means you have no needs to use other worlds for things like Crimson/Corruption Items, or Shadow Orbs or Dungeon Chests and other things as well. Try it out!
This was also one of the very first tModLoader Mods!
You can also melt down armour, tools, and even iron doors with the melter!
Now with more stuff! More than just recipes.
More stuff!

A great thanks to Blockaroz for sprites, and multiplayer testing.

Please give feedback on the mod, if you find anything unbalanced, post it on the forum page. Thanks!
